Exoplanets- our search and biases

My data source is https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=cumulative It is from the NASA DataSet Archive for Exoplanets. The two hypotheses I will be testing are :

Bias exists in the search for exoplanets;
Systems with a G2 or Red Giant star are more likely to have earth-type planets

I have been interested in exoplanets since I was 8 years old, and now that we are having increasing data, I am interested in identifying biases we may have in 
for the exoplanets and where earth-like ones may reside (types of stars, size of planets, etc).
